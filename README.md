# UnityDestructibles

A lag friendly destructible objects using NVidia blast.

This project is build on top of another project: [Destructible-Walls by ElasticSea](https://github.com/ElasticSea/Destructible-Walls)

## How it works

This is a system I made for a game where almost everything has to be destructable, we needed a seemless and lag efficient system for this.
I eventually came across ElasticSea's Destructible-Walls unity asset. There where still 2 major problems with this system, it has a lot of meshes and you can see the sub chunks.
This is why I made this version where the chunks are pre generated by a button in the editor, these chunks only get loaded into the scene when the object has been hit by an object with enough velocity. I also remove chunks that aren't connected to other chunks anymore, this system still uses the realistic physics of ElasticSea's system.
